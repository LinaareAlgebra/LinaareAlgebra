# LinaareAlgebra

```swift
struct LinaareAlgebra: Developer {
  let name = "Lina"
  let languages = ["English", "Deutsch", "Swift", "Python", "Pascal"]
  let skills = "just a bit of SwiftUI, iOS Developer stuff"

  func sayHi() {
    print("Hello! \nHow are you?")
  }

let me = LinaareAlgebra()
me.sayHi()
```

Hi, I'm a newbe to all of this. I'm trying to learn as much as I can. Have a look at my projects / repositories.
